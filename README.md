**Stakeholders:**

My simulation is aimed at a variety of different audiences. One of the main stakeholders are A-level students (possibly even GCSE students or younger children) as the more basic parts of my project can help them understand how orbits work and learn about different bodies (such as neutron stars) and is limited to the A-level specification. This should help them grasp basic concepts that may be examined which would have been hard to learn without some sort of implementation, in this case my simulation.
However, a large section of the simulation is also aimed at those students that are genuinely interested in astrophysics and want to learn more about gravity and orbits. For example, more complex orbits such as elliptical orbits can be illustrated, and students can gain an understanding of how velocity and force vectors work as a bodyâ€™s position in an orbit varies. Moreover, it includes real-life scenarios so they can learn about actual planets in our solar system and is a way for students to recognize if they have an interest.

**Folder Structure**

In hind sight all the source files should be in a sub folder but if I were to change his now it would mess up the file paths to the images/txt files in the other folders.

Existing Scenario Bodies -> Contains the images used in this mode.

Existing Scenario Info   -> Contains the text files containing the output fetched in this mode.

Images                   -> Contains all image files used across the sign up and login and navigation pages

Theory Scenario Info     -> Contains the text files containing the output fetched in this mode.
